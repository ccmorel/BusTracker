# BusTracker
Created by Christopher Morel. 

This was an assignment from the Fullstack Development with MERN bootcamp via MITxPRO. This app is a reflection of my understanding and knowledge of Week 9 as exhibited by the functioning web app. 

How to run: Click the “show stops between MIT & Harvard”, and you will see the route become animated by the marker. 
 
Road-map of future improvements:
I would like to create a reset, and stop button for this so that the user doesnt have to refresh the page to reset the app.
I would like to create a loop function so that the bus route is permanently animated, and reverses once it reaches the end of its route.
I would like to include all bus stops and routes.
I would also like to style the button a little more so it is transparent.
I would love to take the same idea and code it for the subway system here in NYC.
